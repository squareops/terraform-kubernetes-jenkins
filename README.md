This module allows you to run Jenkins inside a cluster, providing improved availability and scalability, which can help manage the deployment, scaling, and configuration of Jenkins.
To use this module, you will need to ensure that your cluster is set up correctly, with shared storage for data persistence and load balancing configured to distribute requests across nodes.
Monitoring and logging tools should be used to keep track of Jenkins' health and performance inside the cluster, and to identify any issues that may arise.

## Important Notes:
This module is compatible with EKS, AKS & GKE which is great news for users deploying the module on an AWS, Azure & GCP cloud. Review the module's documentation, meet specific configuration requirements, and test thoroughly after deployment to ensure everything works as expected.
